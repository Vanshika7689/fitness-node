## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Install **Node.js** and **npm** on your machine.
- Set up **MongoDB** locally or use a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/fitness-node.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

    ```bash
    cd fitness-node
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm install

    ```

4. **Configure Database URI and JWT Secret**:

    Open the Constants/config.js file and update the MongoDB URI and JWT Secret:

    ```js
    // Constants/config.js

    module.exports = {
        DB_URI: 'mongodb://localhost:27017/fitnessdb', // Your MongoDB URI
        JWT_SECRET: 'your_jwt_secret_key',             // Your JWT secret key
    };
    ```

5. **Start the server**:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The server will run on localhost:3000 by default.

## Usage Instructions

Once the server is running, you can interact with the API using tools like **Postman**, **Insomnia**, or any frontend client.

### Base URL

<http://localhost:3000/>
